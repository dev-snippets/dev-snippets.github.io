# Bio
My name is Alin. I'm a **software engineer**(ing manager) currently working in the cybersecurity space. 

My poison of choice is the _.NET ecosystem_ and all the madness associated with building cloud-based systems such as _Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, etc_.

I've been struggling with technology since 2014 and continue to do so, but recently I've been thinking to save & share some of my work here for posterity. 

We'll see how that works...
