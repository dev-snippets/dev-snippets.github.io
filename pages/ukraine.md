Russia began a full-scale [invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine){:target="_blank"}, in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. The invasion is the largest conventional military attack in Europe since World War II.
